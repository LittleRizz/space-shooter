So I am planning for this to be an overhead plane shooter, in the vein of R-Type, or those old plane-shooter games we saw in the arcades 20 years ago.

Ultimately, you'll have a character you can control with the keyboard, pick up powerups and destroy enemies

These are the elements that I would like to get running:

-A sprite shooting bullets
-Enemy getting destroyed by bullets
-Enemy Shoots Back
-Lives
-Score

Then, given time, I would like to make things more complex:
-picking up powerups to shoot different kinds of bullets
-multiple enemies
-Sprite Animations

Finally, if I still have time,
-Scrolling Background
-Boss Fight
